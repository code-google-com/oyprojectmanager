Version History
===============

0.2.5
-----

* Moved back all the database classes to their own modules and removed the
  oyProjectManager.core.models module. All the classes are going to be imported
  to ``oyProjectManager`` namespace, thus it will easy again to import them as
  if they are in the same module::
    
    # instead of
    from oyProjectManager.core.models import Project, Sequence, Shot, Asset
    
    # you can do import them like this.
    from oyProjectManager import Project, Sequence, Shot, Asset

* Tests are now using in memory database, which is way faster then the real
  file based version.

0.2.4.2
-------
* Renamed 'Scene Assembly' to 'Layout' in VersionTypes.

* Added support for Eyeon Fusion.

* Fixed Houdini environment.

* ``version_creator`` UI now lists users in alphabetical order.

0.2.4.1
-------
* Fixed titles of ``version_creator`` and ``status_manager`` UIs.

* Added screenshots to the documentation.

0.2.4
-----
* Added ``type`` attribute to the ``Asset`` class. The main intention is to
  be able to distinguish 'Props', 'Environment' etc. types of assets from each
  other.

* Added ``status`` attribute to the ``Version`` class. This attribute will help
  to track the status of the ``Asset`` or ``Shot`` version.

* Added a new UI called ``status_manager`` for viewing the Assets and Shots
  statuses.

* Added a new column to the ``version_creator`` UI which shows the status of
  the saved version.

* Added a new class called ``Client`` to manage ``Project`` clients.

* Added a new attribute ``client`` to the ``Project`` class to manage
  ``Client``s.

* Updated ``version_creator`` UI, it now shows the Shots in correct numerical
  order.

* Updated ``version_creator`` UI, it is now possible to change the Status or
  Browse the outputs of a Version by right clicking on the Previous Versions
  TableWidget.

* ``Version.status`` is now comparable with long status names, so comparing
  "WTS" with "Waiting To Start" will return True.

* Added the ``query`` method as a class method to the Base class in the
  declarativeBase which will let you do queries directly by using the class
  itself::
    
    # instead of doing this
    projs = db.query(Project).all()
    
    # you can do like this
    projs = Project.query().all()
    
    # To query for an Asset
    my_asset = Asset.query().filter(Asset.name=='test').first()

* The thumbnail path is not stored in the DB anymore but it is always rendered
  from the config file and the attribute is renamed to ``thumbnail_full_path``.

* Added ``shot_editor`` UI which can be reached through ``project_manager``,
  with it you can edit shot info and upload thumbnails for the shot.

* Moved the thumbnail upload procedures to a new module called
  ``oyProjectManager.ui.ui_utils``, and in the future releases all the
  common UI related functionality will be placed in this module to increase
  code reuse.

* The given shot_number is now filtered in Sequence.add_shot(), so giving a
  shot name of "SH001" will create a new shot with shot number is "1" instead
  of "SH001" in which the latter case will result a shot name of "SHSH001", and
  giving a shot number of "00010" will correctly create a shot with the number
  is set to "10" instead of "00010".
  
* Added installation information to the documentation.

* Updated documentation of ``oyProjectManager.config.Config`` and configuration
  of oyProjectManager.

0.2.3
-----

* Added two new fields to ``Shot`` class to hold the handle information.

* Added a new method to ``NukeEnv`` to create slate information.

* Replacing references in ``MayaEnv`` now uses the repository environment
  variable and prevents reloading of the referenced versions upon saving.

* Fixed ``Shot.duration`` attribute initialization.

* Now in ``version_creator`` the shot frame range and handle information can be
  updated.

* Fixed tests of ``version_creator``, the popups were interrupting the test
  while the environment to UI relation was tested. Now the dialog boxes only
  appear if the system is not in debug mode.

* Added thumbnail support and ``version_creator`` UI can load/upload the
  defined thumbnails.

* For a quick fix the template format has been changed in
  ``Sequence.add_shots()``. Compressing shots by using a "-" is not supported
  anymore. This will probably updated later on.

* Changed the name formatting of ``Shot``, ``Asset`` and ``Version``\ . It is
  now allowed to have numbers at the beginning of the string.

* Fixed ``mayaEnv.Maya``, it was raising IntegrityErrors when there are more
  than one references to the same ``Version``\ .

* Fixed a bug in ``version_creator`` where setting the font color was not
  working in PySide, it is now fixed by changing the code to a common way of
  doing it.

* ``version_creator`` ui now displays the file size of the previous versions,
  and will not display the full path of the them anymore.

* Added ``thumbnail_format`` to the config and ``version_creator`` now uses the
  specified format.

* Fixed ``nukeEnv.py`` now it is properly opening ``Version``\ s.
  
* There is now two new settings in the config for time and date formatting of
  previous versions.

* ``version_creator`` now displays the modification time of the previous
  versions.

* Added "Texture Paint" also to the Nuke. So it is now possible to save Nuke
  scenes as Texture files.

* Fixed nukeEnv, the output path is now correctly generated for Assets and
  Shots.

* Changed the default Nuke output to "png"

0.2.2
-----

* Added ``Version.is_published`` attribute to track if a particular Version is
  published.

* ``version_creator`` UI now shows the published ``Version``\ s in green and
  bold font.

* ``User`` instances now have a ``save()`` method to easily save the data to
the database.

* Added ``Show Only Published Versions`` option to the ``version_creator`` UI.

* ``version_creator`` UI now only shows a definite amount of previous Versions,
  and it can be adjustable by the ``version_count_spinBox``.

* Default database placement now uses the ``$OYPROJECTMANAGER_PATH`` instead of
  ``REPO``. It is much better to store ``config.py`` and ``project_manager.db``
  side by side.

* Fixed a bug in ``Sequence`` where it was not able to create two Sequences
  with the same name but for different ``Project``\ s.

* Added the ability work both with PySide and PyQt4 by setting the environment
  variable ``PREFERRED_QT_MODULE`` to ``PySide`` or ``PyQt4`` respectively
  before launching the application (added especially for Nuke 6.3v5 and later
  for their inclusion of PySide to their default install). If no environment
  variable is found then the system will continue to work with PyQt4.

* In Maya the resolution will only be set if the given ``Version`` instances
  version number is 1 to prevent unwanted resolution changes.

* ``mayaEnv.Maya`` now replaces external paths (images and references) with
  absolute paths starting with ``$REPO`` (the env variable name can change
  according to the studio config).

* For Maya environment the support for ``mentalrayTexture``s has ended due to
  the lack of a good environment variable support. Use regular maya ``file``
  nodes for textures with ``mib_texture_filter_lookup`` nodes for the same
  sharp result.

* ``Version`` now has ``is_latest_published_version``.

* Fixed a bug in the ``version_creator`` UI where the ``shots_listWidget`` was
  not correctly cleared after switching the current project from a project with
  sequences to a project without any sequences.

* Fixed a bug in ``mayaEnv`` where it was not able to retrieve the
  list of references correctly under Windows OS which is caused again by the
  backslash issue.

* Updated the ``version_updater`` UI, it now works properly with new
  ``Version`` instances. But it is again not informing the user about
  **deep updates** which will be added in near future releases.

* Fixed the ``version_creator`` UI, for Shots, it was listing all the types
  instead of types which are compatible with the current environment.

* Fixed a bug in ``mayaEnv`` where it was not able to save the scene if
  mentalray is set as the renderer but the mentalrayGlobals node is not
  created yet.

* Converted the ``version_type_comboBox`` and ``takes_comboBox`` to a
  listWidget, which will be much suitable for viewing all the types and takes
  at the first sight.

* ``version_creator`` now only lists active ``Project``\ s.

* Fixed ``maya_env`` references to Versions in the same workspace now updating
  the reference paths correctly by replacing the server path with $REPO.

* Fixed ``maya_env`` referencing a Version now properly initializes the
  reference path with $REPO env variable.

* Fixed a bug in ``version_creator`` UI where it was raising an IndexError
  while restoring the ui with a Version whose Project is not active anymore.

* ``version_creator`` now shows the Projects in sorted order.

* Now the ``Shot.number`` attribute is now compatible with GradientFX's shot
  format, accepts any upper case letters and the dash ("-") character. Also the
  Shot.code is updated accordingly.

* project_properties UI now shows and edits advanced properties like shot
  number padding and prefix, revision number padding and prefix, version number
  padding and prefix and the structure of the Project.

* Updated the default project structure to also include shot folders. So
  calling ``Project.create()`` will create also the Shot folders if there is
  any ``Sequence`` and also ``Shots`` defined.

* Dash ("-") character is now allowed in the version base name

* Updated ``version_updater`` UI, now it warns the user for references with no
  published versions.

* The ``Project.structure`` in was incorrectly configured
  as ``PickleType`` whereas it should be ``String``, it is now fixed.

* Renamed the ``replace_file_paths`` with
  ``nukeEnv.Nuke.replace_external_paths`` and moved it to the
  ``EnvironmentBase`` to make it common in environments.

0.2.1
-----

* Fixed a bug when a ``Project`` doesn't have any Sequence,
  ``Project.create()`` will raise ``OSErrors`` about not being able to create
  the resultant directory which is an empty string.

* Because at time of this release it was hard to reach PySide on every
  platform, the system has been moved back to PyQt4 for now. PySide will
  definitely be used in the future, when all the main programs (Maya, Houdini
  and Nuke) are supporting it (for now it is just Nuke which is delivered with
  PySide).

* Fixed ``config.Config`` it now saves the last_user_id
  properly

* Fixed ``version_creator`` UI, it now saves and retrieves the last user choice
  properly.

* Fixed ``version_creator`` UI, it now only displays Versions with type
  available to the current environment if there is any environment passed to
  it.

* Now in MayaEnv and NukeEnv the output file also includes the
  Project.code and if it is a Shot Version then it also includes the
  Sequence.code in the output file names (ex. rendered images).

0.2.0
-----
* Updated the license to BSD 2.

* Updated the license text on module headers.

0.2.0.b1
--------
* The ``fullpath`` and the ``path`` attributes of the Project will not be
  stored in the database anymore. But instead they will be generated from the
  Project.path and Project.code attributes.

* The concept of paths are enhanced. Now all the paths stored in the database
  is relative to the repository root. So the Version.path attribute of is an
  relative path to the Repository.server_path attribute of Repository class.
  And the templates in the VersionType should be designed in that way.

* Fixed a bug where all the Versions for the same Shot or Asset with the same
  ``take_name`` considered in the same version queue. Thus
  Version.is_latest_version and Version.max_version were not working properly.

* Removed the ``description`` field from the ``version_creator`` UI to make the
  interface more compact and also this kind of information will be available in
  the web ui.

* Added EnvironmentBase.get_version_from_fullpath(),
  EnvironmentBase.get_versions_from_path() and 
  EnvironmentBase.trim_server_path(), methods.

* Added Version.dependency_update_list(). Which returns a list of Version
  instances which are referenced by this Version or are referenced by the
  references of this Version and those have newer versions in the database,
  resulting a deeper update information.

* Fixed a little bug, it is now possible to create VersionableBase instances
  (Asset and Shot instances particularly) with the same ``code`` value if their
  ``project_id`` is not the same.

* To be able to make the Asset.name unique, the column moved to the
  ``VersionableBases`` table which also has the ``project_id`` column.

* Moved the VersionableBase.description attribute, which was a common attribute
  for the Asset and Shot classes.

* The Version.version_number attribute is now depending on to the
  Version.version_of attribute instead of the Version.base_name attribute, to
  prevent the ``version_number`` from being started over from 1 again in case
  of renames in VersionableBase instances attached to a particular Version
  instance.

* Updated the ``project_manager`` ui.

* Sequence will not accept strings for the ``project`` argument anymore.

* The Sequence.name and Sequence.code attributes of are now working as
  expected.

0.2.0a2
-------

* Because every project had its own SQLite3 database it was hard to manage the
  same User in different projects, for that reason the system now uses a
  central database whose placement (if SQLite3) is defined by the config.py.
  Also, the system is able to use different databases than SQLite3. This latest
  improvement added another level of flexibility to the system.

* The ``assetManager.py`` is renamed to ``version_creator.py`` to reflect its
  functionality more clearly. And the interface is redesigned from scratch and
  programmed with TDD practices.

* Because there is a bug in the ``Beaker`` package, reintroduced the
  utils.cache module.

* Added Version.extension attribute to the version.Version class.

* Version class now has ``extension`` and ``output_path`` attributes.

* Renamed the environments back to mayaEnv.py, houdiniEnv.py, nukeEnv.py and
  photoshopEnv.py

* Added ``Version.project` which is a shortcut to the
  ``Version.version_of.project``

* Added ``Version.absolute_path`` which returns the absolute path of the
  version to the Project root.
  
* The ``Version.fullpath` attribute now returns an absolute path.

* The duty of the ``Project.name`` attribute is now shifted to ``Project.code``
  attribute, thus, the ``Project.name`` can now be freely changed, without
  effecting the file management.

* Updated the Sequence.add_shots(), Sequence.add_alternative_shot() and
  Sequence.get_next_alternate_shot_number().

* Added resolution presets to the config file.

* Added ``Project.active`` attribute to track the status of the Project.

0.2.0a1
-------

* The system now uses SQLAlchemy Declarative in its data models. And a new
  settings file located in the Project root with the name ``.metadata.db`` is
  governed to hold the related data for that Project. The system doesn't scan
  the file system anymore but instead uses this ``.metadata.db`` SQLite3 file.
  There are a lot of interface changes in the classes: 

  * The Project.sequenceNames and Project.updateSequenceList methods are no
    longer needed and they don't exist anymore.
  
  * There is no ``readSettings`` method in any of the classes anymore. All the
    settings are read from the database (by retrieving an instance from the db)
    as the instance is created.
  
  * All the XML parsing code is removed. So there is no backward compatibility.
  
  * It was very hard keep the compatibility with the previous versions. So,
    the version 0.2.0 is not backward compatible. The system will look with
    blinking eyes if you try to use it with an old Project.
  
  * The methods:
    
    * ``_parseSequenceDataNode``
    * ``_parseStructureNode``
    * ``_parseAssetTypesNode``
    * ``_parseShotListNode``
    * ``_parseShotDataNode``
    * ``create``
    * ``createShots``
    * ``_sortShots``
    * ``getShot``
    * ``shotList``
    * ``structure``
    * ``createStructure``
    * ``convertToShotString``
    * ``convertToRevString``
    * ``convertToVerString``
    * ``convertToShotNumber``
    * ``convertToRevNumber``
    * ``convertToVerNumber``
    * ``shotPadding``
    * ``shotPrefix``
    * ``getAssetTypes``
    * ``getAssetTypeWithName``
    * ``getAssetFolders``
    * ``projectName``
    * ``getAllAssets``
    * ``getAllAssetsForType``
    * ``getAllAssetFileNamesForType``
    * ``getAssetBaseNamesForType``
    * ``getAllAssetsForTypeAndBaseName``
    * ``filterAssets``
    * ``filterAssetNames``
    * ``generateFakeInfoVariables``
    * ``aFilter``
    * ``undoChange``
    * ``path``
    * ``fullpath``
    * ``projectName``
    * ``timeUnit``
    * ``isValid``
    * ``addNewAssetType``
    * ``exists``
    * ``noSubNameField``
    

    of the Sequence are removed. They were preliminarily used for fake database
    query like behaviour which is greatly handled by SQLAlchemy right now.

* All the models are now placed under one module called
  ``oyProjectManager.core.models``. Thus deleted the old
  ``oyProjectManager.models.project``, ``oyProjectManager.models.asset``,
  ``oyProjectManager.models.user`` modules and the ``oyProjectManager.models``
  module itself.

* ``utils.convertRangeToList`` is renamed to ``utils.uncompress_range``\ .

* Introduced the new ``Version`` class which from now on will hold the
  references to the individual files for every version created for an Asset or
  Shot in the repository. So contrary to the previous implementation an Asset
  is not the reference of the individual version files of itself any more.

* Introduced the VersionableBase class Shot and Asset is derived from. Thus
  allow them to hold references to Versions.

* Repository now uses the ``REPO`` environment variable instead of
  ``STALKER_REPOSITORY_PATH``.

* All the project settings are now stored in the Project class.

* The ``timeUnit`` concept is replaced with ``fps``. To define the timeUnit
  (which is very much a specific naming convention for Maya only) set the
  Project.fps.

* It is now possible to set a project image format by setting the
  Project.width, Project.height, Project.pixel_aspect attributes.

* The Shot class now initializes with Shot.number attribute and the Shot.code
  attribute Shot.number and the Project.shot_prefix and Project.shot_padding
  attributes.

* There is no ``Structure`` class anymore. The function is accomplished by the
  Project class itself.

* The system now uses the ``OYPROJECTMANAGER_PATH`` to search a file called
  ``conf.py`` and uses this file to configure the system. See
  :mod:`~oyProjectManager.config` documentation for more details.

* Renamed the environment modules:
  
  * ``houdiniEnv.py`` --> ``houdini.py``
  * ``mayaEnv.py`` --> ``maya.py``
  * ``nukeEnv.py`` --> ``nuke.py``
  * ``photoshopEnv.py`` --> ``photoshop.py``
  
  To ease the move of separate environment class concept, which will be
  introduced in version 0.3.0

* Updated the Repository class, now it is only doing repository related things.
  The following methods are removed:
  
  * ``_init_repository_path_environment_variable`` (no environment variables to
    init anymore)
  * ``_parse_repository_settings`` (nothing to parse anymore)
  * ``projects`` (use ``Repository.project_names`` instead)
  * ``valid_projects`` (use ``Repository.project_names`` all the names are for
    valid projects -projects with .metadata.db- only)
  * ``users`` (it is Project's duty to return a list of users in the project,
    and a full list of user names and corresponding user name initials can be
    retrieved from ``oyProjectManager.config.Config.users``)
  * ``user_names`` (can be retrieved from
    ``oyProjectManager.config.Config.users``)
  * ``user_initials`` (can be retrieved from
    ``oyProjectManager.config.Config.users``)
  * ``_parse_users`` (nothing to parse anymore)
  * ``createProject`` (use::
      
      from oyProjectManager.core.models import Project
      new_proj = Project("NEW_PROJECT")
      new_proj.create()
    
    no need to introduce a new method)
    
  * ``defaultFiles`` (is handled by the environments, not by the repository)
  * ``default_settings_file_full_path`` (no default settings file anymore)
  * ``home_path`` (it is os.path.expanduser("~") no need to create new method)
  * ``last_user`` (use config.Config.last_user_initial attribute instead)
  * ``get_project_and_sequence_name_from_file_path`` (use
    Repository.get_project_name() instead, it is not possible to get the
    Sequence name for now)
  * ``settings_dir_path`` (no settings dir)
  * ``time_units`` (no time unit concept, use Project.fps instead)
